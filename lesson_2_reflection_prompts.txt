What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A super secret Git file is created with all the neccasary data to make commits and view logs.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Nothing has officially been committed or saved in the staging area. It is merely a place to isolate that which has changed from that which has not changed.
